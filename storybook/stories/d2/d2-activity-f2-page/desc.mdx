# Activity



In the context of a Voluntary Emissions Reductions (VERs) project protocol, activities refer to the specific actions or tasks that are undertaken as part of the project development and implementation process. These activities can include things like:

 - Project planning: This involves developing a project plan that outlines the goals, objectives, and timeline for the VERs project.
 - Baseline data collection: This involves collecting data on the current emissions levels of the project area, in order to establish a baseline against which emissions reductions can be measured.
 - Emissions calculations: This involves using approved methodologies to calculate the emissions reductions achieved by the project.
 - Emissions monitoring and reporting: This involves ongoing monitoring and reporting of emissions data throughout the project lifespan, in order to ensure that emissions reductions are being achieved and accurately measured.
 - Third-party verification: This involves engaging an independent third-party organization to verify the emissions reductions achieved by the project.
