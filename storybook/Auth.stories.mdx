# API Authentication Using OAuth2.0

OAuth2.0 is a protocol that allows a user to grant a third-party website or application access to their resources,
without necessarily revealing their credentials. In other words, it's a secure and standard method
to authenticate and authorize your API.

To authenticate to an API using OAuth2.0 with a `clientId` and `clientSecret`,
you typically follow the Client Credentials flow. Here is a simple guide to help you through the process.


## Step 1: Get Your ClientId and ClientSecret

The `clientId` and `clientSecret` are provided by the API provider. The `clientId` is a public identifier
for your application, and the `clientSecret` is a secret known only to the application and the authorization server.


## Step 2: Request an Access Token

To request an access token, your application sends a POST request to the authorization server's token endpoint.
The POST request includes the `clientId` and `clientSecret` in the header. It should look something like this:

```bash
export CLIENT_ID="your_client_id"
export CLIENT_SECRET="your_client_secret"

curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=$CLIENT_ID&client_secret=$CLIENT_SECRET" \
  https://auth.connect.smart-b.io/realms/sb-dev/protocol/openid-connect/token
```

Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` and `YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET` with your actual `clientId` and `clientSecret`.


## Step 3: Receive and Store the Access Token

The authorization server will respond with a JSON object containing an access token if the request is successful.
This will look something like:

```json
{
	"access_token": "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN",
	"expires_in": 28800,
	"refresh_expires_in": 0,
	"token_type": "Bearer",
	"not-before-policy": 0,
	"scope": "profile email"
}
```

The `access_token` is the token your application will use to authenticate against the required API.
The `expires_in` field contains the number of seconds until the token expires.


## Step 4: Use the Access Token

To use the access token, include it in the header of your API requests. This typically looks like this:

```bash
export YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN="your_access_token"

curl -X POST https://trace.smart-b.io/ver/assetTransfer \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
     -d '{
           "poolId": "4519f147-5a27-4474-9950-234c4aed87b6",
           "sender": "SmartB",
           "receiver": "Phease",
           "quantity": 500
         }'
```

Replace `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN` with the access token you received from the authorization server.


## Conclusion

Using OAuth2.0 with a `clientId` and `clientSecret` for API authentication is a secure and standardized method.
This guide provides the basic steps involved in this process. For more details, always refer
to the specific documentation provided by the API provider. Remember to handle and store
your `clientSecret` and received `access_token` securely to prevent unauthorized access to your services.
