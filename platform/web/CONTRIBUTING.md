# React app developpement rules

You must make sure that each one of the following rules is respected before going through any merge.

## Organization

- A component should be placed either:
  - In the `component` package if it's a generic component that can be used anywhere in the app,every component in this package must have a story to be displayed in storybook.
  - In `X2-app/src/App/pages/{the name of the page were the component will be placed}/components` if the component is directly linked to specific data of the app.
  - Or in the `domain-components` package if the component is directly linked to specific data of the app but still shared in different parts of the app.
- An utility function, hook or object should be placed in the package `utils`. Note that you shouldn't place something directly linked to some data in the package `utils`.
- A type declaration or a request function direcly link the back-end data or ts compilation should be placed in the package `datahub`.
- A new page should be created according to the templates: `web-app/templates/PageExample`
- A string shouldn't be given directly to a component. You should use I18n and store the string in the translation.json files

## State persistance

We got ride of redux as it is a too much complex library for the use we had of it. We migrated to [react-query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) for the server state persistance. If you need client state persistance please consider using something smaller than redux like [zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) or the browser local storage with https://mantine.dev/hooks/use-local-storage/.

## Translation files organization

A simple word or sentence that you think will be re-use elsewhere in the app should be stored in the root of the json file and its key should be the word or the sentence in camel case.

Otherwise you should respect this structure:

```JSON
{
    "the name of the page, the context (special cases like 'errorMessage'), or the component (if it's a big one) in camel case": {
        (optionally)"the name of the part of the page in camel case": {
             "the word or the sentence or the summary(if the sentence is to long) in camel case": "the string"
        },
        "the word or the sentence of the summary(if the sentence is to long) in camel case": "the string"
    }
}
```

## Performance

In order to maintain the performances of the app you should respect the following rules:

- Each function passed as a prop to a children should be created in a `useCallback`
- Each complex dynamic object created in a component should be placed in a getter outside the component and assigned in a `useMemo`
- Each complex static object should be placed outside the component.
- You should never create a complexe object or a function in the jsx code. A jsx element resulting of a map function should be placed in a `useMemo`
- You should rarely or never create an array in the jsx code or in the component. React have difficulties to deep equals an array, it should be created in a `useMemo` as well.

❌ What you should not do:

```JSX
export const MyComponent = (props) => {
    const {anArray} = props
    const myObject = [{
        name: "example"
    },
    {
        name: "example"
    }]
    return (
      <div onClick={() => {some behavior}}>
        {anArray.map((item) => (
            <p>
                {myObject[0].name}
            </p>
        ))}
      </div>
    )
}
```

✅ What you should do:

```JSX
export const MyComponent = (props) => {
    const {anArray} = props
    const myObject = useMemo(getObject, [dependencies])
    const onClick = useCallback(
        () => {some behavior},
        [dependencies],
    )
    const myElement = useMemo(() => anArray.map((item) => (
            <p>
                {myObject[0].name}
            </p>
        )), [myObject, anArray]
    )
    return (
      <div onClick={onClick}>
        {myElement}
      </div>
    )
}

const getObject = () => ([{
    name: "example"
},
{
    name: "example"
}])
```

## Styles

To follow the new styling rules of mui you should use the prop sx almost every time https://mui.com/system/the-sx-prop/#main-content

If your style declaration becomes too big or you want to make a reusable component by changing only the styles of another one use the styled decorator: https://mui.com/system/styled/#main-content

## Maintainability

Every file component should be less than 200 lines long. Try to destructure it as much as possible to avoid exceeding 150 lines.
