/**
 * An activity is a task or set of tasks that need to be completed in order to
 * achieve a particular goal or objective. Activities can be performed by individuals or teams,
 * and they can range from simple, routine tasks to complex, multi-step processes.
 *
 * Activities often have specific deadlines or timeframes in which they need to be completed,
 * and they may also require specific resources or inputs in order to be carried out effectively.
 * In some cases, activities may also require collaboration or coordination
 * with other individuals or teams.
 *
 * Effective management of activities is important in many contexts, such as project management,
 * task tracking, and workflow optimization. This may involve the use of tools and techniques
 * such as activity planning, scheduling, monitoring, and reporting, in order to ensure that
 * activities are completed efficiently and effectively.
