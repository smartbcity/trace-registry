 * 1. Project planning: This involves developing a project plan that outlines the goals, objectives, and timeline for the VERs project.
 * 2. Baseline data collection: This involves collecting data on the current emissions levels of the project area, in order to establish a baseline against which emissions reductions can be measured.
 * 3. Emissions calculations: This involves using approved methodologies to calculate the emissions reductions achieved by the project.
 * 4. Emissions monitoring and reporting: This involves ongoing monitoring and reporting of emissions data throughout the project lifespan, in order to ensure that emissions reductions are being achieved and accurately measured.
 * 5. Third-party verification: This involves engaging an independent third-party organization to verify the emissions reductions achieved by the project.
