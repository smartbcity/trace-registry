/**
 * Voluntary Emissions Reductions (VERs) projects are projects that are voluntarily implemented by organizations, businesses, or individuals to reduce their carbon emissions. VERs are a type of greenhouse gas (GHG) offset, where an organization reduces its GHG emissions in excess of its legal or regulatory requirements, and the resulting emissions reductions can be sold as offsets to other organizations. The goal of VERs projects is to reduce the net amount of GHGs released into the atmosphere, as a means of mitigating the effects of climate change.
 * VERs projects can be implemented in various sectors, including energy, transportation, agriculture, forestry, and waste management. Examples of VERs projects include renewable energy projects, energy efficiency upgrades, and reforestation efforts. The reductions from a VERs project are verified, monitored, and verified to ensure that they are real, additional, and permanent, and are then sold as offsets to organizations looking to offset their own emissions. VERs projects can provide companies and individuals with a means of reducing their carbon footprint, while also supporting low-carbon and sustainable development initiatives.
